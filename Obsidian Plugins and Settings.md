## Folder notes

By Lost Paul
https://github.com/LostPaul/obsidian-folder-notes

Folder notes lets you attach notes to folders so that you can click on the name of a folder to open the note like in the appÂ [Notion](https://www.notion.so/). This plugin has some unique features that separate it from similar "Folder note" plugins, such as opening folder notes through the path, creating folder notes for every existing folder, templater/template support, and more.

## Tag Wrangler

Rename, merge, toggle, and search tags from the tag pane.
## Update time on edit

Ensures that new notes get a front matter `created` timestamp and that updated notes receive a `modified` timestamp.

Standard plugin settings:

- Front matter updated name: modified
- Front matter created name: created
