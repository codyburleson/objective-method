## Context

Deep understanding requires moving beyond surface-level knowledge through systematic questioning, but this process is often random or superficial. Personal knowledge workers need structured ways to deepen their understanding through progressive inquiry.

## Problem

How can we systematically deepen our understanding of concepts through structured questioning that builds upon itself and reveals new layers of insight?

## Forces

- Understanding develops through questioning
- Different questions reveal different aspects
- Questions build on previous answers
- Inquiry paths aren't always obvious
- Development requires systematic approach
- Questions need logical progression
- Understanding gaps need identification
- Different concepts need different questions
- Time constraints limit exploration

## Solution

Create cascading series of questions that:

1. Start with foundational questions
2. Progress through levels:
    - Basic understanding
    - Clarification
    - Context/background
    - Implications
    - Applications
    - Connections
    - Challenges
    - Synthesis

Structure questions to:

- Build on previous answers
- Reveal new perspectives
- Challenge assumptions
- Identify gaps
- Prompt deeper thinking
- Generate new questions

## Implementation

1. Create question templates for different types of content
2. Start with basic comprehension questions
3. Progress through deeper levels:
    - What is it?
    - Why does it matter?
    - How does it work?
    - What are the implications?
    - Where does it apply?
    - What are its limitations?
    - How does it connect?
    - What if...?
4. Document answers and new questions
5. Review and iterate

## Examples

- Concept exploration sequences
- Research question chains
- Learning inquiry paths
- Problem analysis cascades
- Critical thinking prompts
- Understanding development paths

## Resulting Context

- Deeper understanding
- Systematic inquiry habits
- Identified knowledge gaps
- Better critical thinking
- Enhanced connections
- Clearer thinking paths
- Improved retention
- More thorough analysis
