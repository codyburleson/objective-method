## Context

Personal knowledge bases often contain a mix of temporary and permanent content, with key concepts evolving over time. Users need ways to maintain and develop foundational notes that remain relevant and grow more valuable through continued development.

## Problem

How can we create and maintain notes that evolve and improve over time while serving as stable building blocks for our knowledge system?

## Forces

- Understanding evolves over time
- Key concepts need ongoing development
- Notes should improve with use
- Foundational ideas deserve investment
- Knowledge builds on itself
- Updates need to preserve context
- Integration requires stable references
- Development should be continuous
- Value increases through iteration

## Solution

Create and maintain evergreen notes that:

1. Focus on fundamental concepts
2. Are written for future understanding
3. Get better with each revision
4. Maintain version history
5. Link densely to other notes
6. Support ongoing development

Characteristics:

- Atomic concepts
- Clear titles
- Own words
- Dense linking
- Regular updates
- Concept stability
- Growing context
- Progressive refinement

## Implementation

1. Identify foundational concepts
2. Write initial atomic notes
3. Establish regular review cycles
4. Update based on new insights
5. Maintain version history
6. Add new connections
7. Refine explanations
8. Track development over time

## Examples

- Core concept notes
- Principle documentation
- Method descriptions
- Framework explanations
- Personal philosophy notes
- Fundamental definitions
- Key process documentation

## Resulting Context

- Growing knowledge base
- Improved understanding
- Stable reference points
- Enhanced connections
- Better retention
- Clearer thinking
- Supported development
- Valuable long-term resource
