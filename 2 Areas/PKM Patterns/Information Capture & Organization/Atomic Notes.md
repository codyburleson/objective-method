## Context

Knowledge management systems often contain complex, interconnected information. Traditional note-taking approaches tend to create long, multi-topic documents that are difficult to reuse, link, and maintain. Users need a way to capture information that supports both detailed understanding and flexible recombination.

## Problem

How can we structure notes to maximize their reusability, clarity, and ability to form new connections while maintaining sufficient context for understanding?

## Forces

- Complex ideas contain multiple interconnected concepts
- Long notes are harder to link precisely
- Multi-topic notes limit recombination potential
- Notes need enough context to stand alone
- Information naturally wants to cluster
- Users need to see both trees and forest
- Reuse requires modular structure
- Ideas evolve through new combinations
- Understanding develops through connections
- Single concepts can apply in multiple contexts

## Solution

Create notes that:

1. Focus on exactly one concept, idea, or insight
2. Are self-contained and comprehensible on their own
3. Keep to a limited size (usually 1-3 paragraphs)
4. Use clear, specific titles
5. Include necessary context without over-explaining
6. Link to related atomic notes for broader concepts

Each atomic note should:

- Express a complete thought
- Be uniquely addressable
- Stand alone meaningfully
- Support recombination
- Enable precise linking
- Maintain appropriate scope

## Implementation

1. When capturing information:
    - Identify distinct concepts
    - Break complex ideas into atomic components
    - Create separate notes for each concept
    - Write clear, descriptive titles
    - Include minimal necessary context
    - Link between related atomic notes
2. Keep testing if notes can:
    - Stand alone meaningfully
    - Be understood without context
    - Be reused in different contexts
    - Link precisely to other notes
3. Refactor existing notes into atomic units when needed

## Examples

- Single concept: "Photosynthesis converts light energy to chemical energy"
- Single argument: "Spaced repetition improves long-term memory"
- Single observation: "Desire paths show natural user behavior"
- Single technique: "The Feynman Technique for learning"
- Single principle: "Gall's Law about system complexity"
- Single distinction: "Difference between accuracy and precision"

## Resulting Context

- Improved idea recombination
- Clearer linking between concepts
- Better reusability of notes
- Easier maintenance and updates
- More precise knowledge graphs
- Supported emergent structure
- Enhanced understanding through chunking
- Flexible knowledge organization
