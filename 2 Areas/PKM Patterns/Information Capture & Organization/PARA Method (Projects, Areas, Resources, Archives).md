## Context

Knowledge workers manage many types of information across multiple projects, responsibilities, and interests. Without a clear organizational framework, digital content becomes scattered and difficult to find when needed. Users need a system that balances actionability with archival while maintaining clarity and reducing cognitive overhead.

## Problem

How can we organize digital information in a way that reflects both its actionability and relevance while making it easy to find, maintain, and archive?

## Forces

- Information has varying levels of actionability and relevance
- Projects and responsibilities change over time
- Some information needs quick access, other information needs preservation
- Too many organizational categories create decision fatigue
- Too few categories lead to unclear boundaries and mixing of concerns
- Organization should support both action and reference
- Users need clarity about where to put and find things
- Information's relevance and actionability changes over time

## Solution

Organize all digital information into four main categories that reflect descending levels of actionability:

1. Projects: Active initiatives with clear goals and deadlines
2. Areas: Ongoing responsibilities requiring maintenance over time
3. Resources: Topics of interest for reference and personal development
4. Archives: Inactive items from other categories

Each category has distinct characteristics:

- Projects are time-bound and goal-oriented
- Areas are ongoing with standards to maintain
- Resources are topics of interest without immediate actionability
- Archives preserve completed or inactive items for potential future reference

## Implementation

1. Create four top-level containers (folders/notebooks) for P.A.R.A.
2. Define clear criteria for each category:
    - Projects: Has a deadline and defined outcome
    - Areas: Has ongoing standards to maintain
    - Resources: Relevant but not immediately actionable
    - Archives: Inactive or completed
3. Sort existing information into these categories
4. Place new information immediately in appropriate category
5. Review and maintain:
    - Complete projects move to Archives
    - Areas are evaluated for relevance
    - Resources are curated based on interest
    - Archives are pruned periodically

## Examples

- Projects: "Website Redesign", "Book Manuscript", "Vacation Planning"
- Areas: "Health", "Finance", "Professional Development"
- Resources: "Web Design", "Productivity", "History"
- Archives: "Completed Projects 2023", "Old Blog Posts", "Past Courses"

## Resulting Context

- Clear decision-making about where to store information
- Reduced cognitive overhead in organization
- Natural workflow from active to inactive states
- Easy identification of actionable items
- Preserved access to historical information
- Scalable across different tools and platforms
- Balanced actionability and reference needs
