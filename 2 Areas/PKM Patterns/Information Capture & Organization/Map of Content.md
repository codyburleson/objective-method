## Context

In a personal knowledge management system, notes proliferate rapidly and can become difficult to navigate. Traditional hierarchical folders are too rigid, while pure link-based systems can become chaotic. Users need a way to create flexible, meaningful organization without sacrificing the benefits of organic note linking.

## Problem

How can we create navigable structure in a web of interconnected notes without imposing rigid hierarchies that limit organic growth and emergence of new relationships?

## Forces

* Notes naturally form clusters around topics and themes
* Users need multiple ways to access and discover their notes
* Pure tag systems become unwieldy at scale
* Hierarchical structures are too rigid for evolving knowledge
* Direct note-to-note links alone can create a confusing maze
* Knowledge structure should emerge from use rather than being predetermined
* Users need both high-level overview and detailed access
* Organization should support both planned and spontaneous knowledge work

## Solution

Create dedicated notes that serve as curated indexes and navigation hubs for specific topics or areas of interest. These "Maps of Content" (MOCs) contain:

1. A clear scope statement defining the territory the map covers
2. Carefully selected links to relevant notes, organized meaningfully
3. Brief contextual descriptions for linked notes
4. Optional structural elements like sections, categories, or sequences
5. Links to related MOCs at the same or different levels of abstraction

MOCs can be nested and interlinked to create flexible hierarchies that emerge naturally from use. They serve as both navigational tools and thinking spaces where relationships between notes can be explored and developed.

## Implementation

1. Begin creating an MOC when you notice a cluster of related notes forming
2. Write a clear scope statement at the top
3. Add links to relevant notes with brief contextual descriptions
4. Organize links in a way that serves your thinking and navigation needs
5. Add structural elements (sections, sequences) as patterns emerge
6. Link to related MOCs to create layers of organization
7. Regularly revise as your understanding and note collection evolves

## Examples

* A "Writing Techniques MOC" linking to notes on style, structure, and process
* A "Project X MOC" gathering all notes related to a specific project
* A "Biology Concepts MOC" organizing notes on biological principles
* A high-level "Knowledge Atlas MOC" linking to other major MOCs

## Resulting Context

* Natural emergence of flexible organizational structures
* Multiple paths to discover and access notes
* Clear entry points into topic areas
* Support for both top-down and bottom-up organization
* Preserved benefits of organic note linking
* Reduced cognitive overhead in navigation
* Improved ability to see connections and patterns
