## Context

As personal knowledge bases grow, understanding the relationships between pieces of information becomes increasingly complex. Traditional hierarchical or linear organizations fail to capture the rich network of connections between ideas.

## Problem

How can we visualize and interact with the complex web of relationships between notes and ideas in a way that reveals meaningful patterns, supports navigation, and enhances understanding?

## Forces

- Knowledge is inherently networked
- Relationships are multi-dimensional
- Visual representation aids understanding
- Graphs can become overwhelmingly complex
- Different views serve different purposes
- Connections evolve over time
- Users need both overview and detail
- Navigation should be intuitive
- Pattern recognition requires context

## Solution

Create interactive visual representations of knowledge networks that:

1. Show notes as nodes
2. Display relationships as edges
3. Support different types of relationships
4. Enable filtering and focusing
5. Allow interactive navigation
6. Provide multiple views and layouts
7. Support both global and local perspectives

Key features:

- Interactive visualization
- Relationship typing
- Filtering capabilities
- Focus+context views
- Clustering algorithms
- Path highlighting
- Search integration

## Implementation

1. Generate graph from note connections
2. Implement interactive navigation
3. Create useful filtering options
4. Design clear visual language
5. Support different view modes
6. Enable relationship typing
7. Maintain performance at scale

## Examples

- Full knowledge base graph
- Project-specific subgraphs
- Concept relationship maps
- Research connection graphs
- Learning path visualizations
- Citation networks

## Resulting Context

- Better understanding of knowledge structure
- Enhanced pattern recognition
- Easier navigation of complex relationships
- Improved context awareness
- Supported serendipitous discovery
- Clearer knowledge gaps
- Better decision making
