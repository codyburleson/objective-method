## Context

Personal knowledge workers invest significant time in capturing and processing information but often struggle with long-term retention and internalization. Traditional review methods are either too frequent (wasteful) or too infrequent (ineffective).

## Problem

How can we systematically review our knowledge base in a way that maximizes retention and understanding while minimizing time investment and cognitive overhead?

## Forces

- Knowledge fades without review
- Different content needs different review schedules
- Time for review is limited
- Review needs change with familiarity
- Some content needs more frequent review
- Review should be efficient
- Scheduling must be maintainable
- Retention requires active engagement
- Review motivation fluctuates

## Solution

Implement a spaced repetition system that:

1. Schedules reviews at increasing intervals
2. Adjusts based on recall performance
3. Prioritizes important content
4. Tracks review history
5. Supports different types of review

Key components:

- Review intervals (1, 4, 10, 30, 90, 180 days...)
- Difficulty ratings
- Priority markers
- Review history
- Performance tracking
- Automated scheduling
- Review prompts

## Implementation

1. Tag notes for review
2. Assign initial intervals
3. Create review schedule
4. During review:
    - Active recall
    - Update understanding
    - Rate difficulty
    - Adjust intervals
    - Add new connections
5. Track progress
6. Adjust system based on results

## Examples

- Concept review schedules
- Learning milestone checks
- Project knowledge review
- Reference material updates
- Process understanding checks
- Key insight reinforcement

## Resulting Context

- Better long-term retention
- Efficient review process
- Improved understanding
- Maintained knowledge
- Clear review priorities
- Sustainable practice
- Enhanced recall
- Growing mastery
