## Context

Knowledge and understanding evolve over time, but previous versions of thoughts and ideas can contain valuable context and insights. Personal knowledge workers need ways to track and access the evolution of their thinking while maintaining current understanding.

## Problem

How can we track the evolution of our ideas and knowledge over time while maintaining access to previous versions and understanding the development path of our thinking?

## Forces

- Ideas evolve continuously
- Previous versions have value
- Context changes over time
- Development paths matter
- Storage space is limited
- Version tracking takes effort
- Changes need documentation
- History provides insight
- Previous context important

## Solution

Create a version history system that:

1. Tracks significant changes
2. Preserves important versions
3. Documents development path
4. Maintains context
5. Supports comparison
6. Enables rollback

Key components:

- Change timestamps
- Version notes
- Development commentary
- Context preservation
- Comparison tools
- Recovery options
- Path documentation

## Implementation

1. Establish version tracking:
    - Date stamps
    - Change descriptions
    - Context notes
    - Development rationale
2. Define significant changes
3. Create version documentation
4. Maintain change log
5. Enable version comparison
6. Support recovery options
7. Track development paths

## Examples

- Concept development history
- Understanding evolution
- Project development paths
- Research progression
- Learning journeys
- Thinking development
- Knowledge growth paths

## Resulting Context

- Tracked idea development
- Preserved context
- Clear evolution paths
- Available history
- Recoverable versions
- Better understanding
- Visible progress
- Learning insights
