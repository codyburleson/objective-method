## Context

Personal knowledge bases grow organically over time, leading to outdated information, broken connections, and overgrown areas. Without regular maintenance, the system becomes less reliable and harder to navigate.

## Problem

How can we systematically maintain our knowledge base to keep it relevant, accurate, and useful while preventing decay and managing growth without becoming overwhelmed by maintenance tasks?

## Forces

- Knowledge bases naturally grow
- Links break over time
- Understanding evolves
- Content becomes outdated
- Connections need verification
- Growth can become unwieldy
- Maintenance takes time
- Perfect organization impossible
- Different areas need different care
- Regular attention required

## Solution

Implement a systematic garden maintenance routine:

1. Regular Review Cycles:
    - Daily quick checks
    - Weekly reviews
    - Monthly deeper cleans
    - Quarterly major maintenance
2. Maintenance Tasks:
    - Update outdated content
    - Fix broken links
    - Merge duplicate notes
    - Archive inactive content
    - Strengthen connections
    - Prune redundant information
    - Clarify unclear sections
    - Enhance metadata
3. Growth Management:
    - Controlled expansion
    - Strategic pruning
    - Path clearing
    - Structure reinforcement

## Implementation

1. Create maintenance schedule
2. Define maintenance tasks:
    - Link verification
    - Content updates
    - Connection reviews
    - Archive decisions
    - Structure adjustments
3. Use maintenance checklists
4. Track changes and updates
5. Set review reminders
6. Document maintenance decisions
7. Balance growth with pruning

## Examples

- Broken link checks
- Outdated content reviews
- Connection verification
- Archive assessments
- Structure evaluations
- Format standardization
- Tag cleanup sessions

## Resulting Context

- Maintained knowledge base
- Reliable connections
- Current information
- Clear navigation
- Managed growth
- Sustainable system
- Enhanced usefulness
- Improved findability
