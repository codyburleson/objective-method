## Context

Knowledge in personal systems moves through distinct stages from initial capture to eventual archive or deletion. Without understanding and managing these stages, information can stagnate, become outdated, or create unnecessary cognitive overhead.

## Problem

How can we effectively manage information through its complete lifecycle, from initial capture to final disposition, while ensuring appropriate handling at each stage and smooth transitions between stages?

## Forces

- Information has natural lifespans
- Different stages need different handling
- Transitions require decisions
- Storage is finite
- Value changes over time
- Processing requires resources
- Content becomes outdated
- Archives need organization
- Retrieval needs change
- Stages aren't always linear

## Solution

Create a structured lifecycle management system with defined stages:

1. Capture
    - Quick entry
    - Basic context
    - Source preservation
    - Initial tagging
2. Processing
    - Evaluation
    - Organization
    - Integration
    - Development
3. Active Use
    - Regular access
    - Ongoing updates
    - Connection building
    - Application
4. Maintenance
    - Regular review
    - Updates
    - Verification
    - Refinement
5. Archive/Sunset
    - Value assessment
    - Context preservation
    - Accessibility decisions
    - Storage optimization

## Implementation

1. Define lifecycle stages
2. Create stage transition criteria
3. Establish handling procedures:
    - Entry requirements
    - Processing guidelines
    - Maintenance schedules
    - Archive criteria
    - Deletion rules
4. Track content status
5. Regular lifecycle review
6. Document transition decisions

## Examples

- Project knowledge lifecycle
- Research information flow
- Learning material progression
- Reference content aging
- Task knowledge evolution
- Resource development paths
- Idea maturation tracking

## Resulting Context

- Organized information flow
- Clear handling procedures
- Appropriate resource allocation
- Managed storage
- Preserved value
- Efficient retrieval
- Reduced overhead
- Sustainable system
