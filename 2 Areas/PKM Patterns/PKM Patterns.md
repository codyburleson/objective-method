> [!info] A pattern language for Personal Knowledge Management.
> A pattern language is an organized and coherent set of patterns, each describing a problem and the core of a solution that can be used in many ways within a specific field of expertise.Â The term was coined by architect [[Christopher Alexander]] and popularized by his 1977 book [[A Pattern Language - Towns, Buildings, Construction|A Pattern Language]].

We asked the Claude LLM to give us recommendations for our PKM pattern language and received the following structured set of potential patterns, organized by their core functions.

1. Information Capture & Organization

- [[Map of Content]] - a high-level navigational overview
- [[Atomic Notes]] - breaking information into single-concept units
- [[Progressive Summarization]] - layers of highlighting/summarization for quick review
- [[PARA Method (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives)]] - organizational framework
- [[Zettelkasten ID System]] - unique identifiers for notes

2. Connection & Discovery

- [[Bidirectional Linking]] - creating two-way connections between notes
- [[Concept Clustering]] - grouping related ideas
- [[Trail Marker]] - breadcrumb navigation through thought processes
- [[Emergence Board]] - space for noticing patterns across notes
- [[Knowledge Graph]] - visual representation of note connections

3. Processing & Development

- [[Literature Notes to Permanent Notes]] - transformation of raw captures
- [[Idea Incubator]] - designated space for developing thoughts
- [[Question Cascade]] - series of prompts to deepen understanding
- [[Synthesis Matrix]] - comparing multiple sources/viewpoints
- [[Evergreen Notes]] - continuously updated foundational concepts

4. Review & Maintenance

- Spaced Repetition - systematic review schedule
- Garden Maintenance - regular pruning and updating of notes
- Version History - tracking evolution of ideas
- Knowledge Lifecycle - stages from capture to archive
